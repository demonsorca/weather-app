# weather-app
It's an app which gives information about current weather around you.

## Introduction
I've created an weather app using React Native and its lib's, expo-location lib from expo and Expo-cli for server side.

API was used from openweathermap.org.

## Demo
You can test it by using these steps:
- Install Expo app from playstore.
- Open Expo app and scan the QR code shown in this link(https://expo.dev/@demons_orca/weather-app) and there you go!

## Setup
-run npm i && npm start
